title: Welcome to Mat Embedds Things

I program for embedded systems. The kind of stuff that runs on hardware, where you actually have to think about what your code is doing because resources are limited and every cycle matters.

I like building things that are elegant under the hood; code that's clean, makes sense, and doesn't make the next person who reads it want to throw their laptop out a window. There's something satisfying about writing tight, efficient code that just works.

## What I'm into

Mostly working on embedded projects where the constraints are real. Interrupt handlers, hardware interfaces, real-time system. I care about writing code that's both efficient and maintainable, which honestly shouldn't be mutually exclusive but somehow often is.

Occasionally I'll catch myself doing some projects on higher level systems, writing programs for the GPU, some web-UI work (mostly vibe coded), and ROS2 nodes in C++ for robotics applications.

If you want to chat about embedded systems or collaborate on something interesting, feel free to reach out.

Also, I love grilled cheese.
